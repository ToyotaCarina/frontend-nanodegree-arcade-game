In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).  
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.   
The player can move left, right, up and down.  
Sometimes a Rock can appear on the water. It blocks the way for a Player.
Up to 3 gems can appear in the game. There are 3 different colors of the gems: blue, green and orange.  
Each color gives different number of points. When Player collects a gem, number of points shows on the screen.  
The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.  
Once a the player collides with an enemy, you loose 1 life and the player moves back to the start square.   
Once the player reaches the water, you get a 100 points and player moves back to the start square.   
The game is over when you lost all your 6 lives.
